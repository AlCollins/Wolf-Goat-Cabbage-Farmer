======================

Assignment #1 for course 4753 Artificial Intelligence. 
Intelligently solves the classic wolf, goat, cabbage, farmer problem. 

-------
###Problem Description
A wolf, a goat, a cabbage, and a farmer are on the west bank of a river and wish to cross to the east side, but only have a boat that can fit the farmer and one other thing. The wolf will eat the goat if the farmer leaves them alone and the goat will eat the cabbage if left alone. How can the farmer bring everything across to the east bank? 

-------
###How to run
```
python wgcf.py
```
This has been coded using python 2.7. 
Output is an array representing the current state. W means the thing is on the west back and E means the thing is on the East bank. The following positions represent the following things. 
0 : wolf
1: goat
2: cabbage
3: farmer

-------

side note: why does a farmer want to transport a wolf across a river? Who would want to get in a boat with a wolf?
